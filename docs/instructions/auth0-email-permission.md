# Auth0 Email Permission Addition

## Date: 2025-01-05

### Changes Made
1. Updated the Auth0 configuration in `authService.ts` to request the 'read:email' scope along with default scopes
2. Modified the token request to include all necessary scopes: 'openid profile email read:email'

### Technical Details
- Added 'read:email' scope to the Auth0 token request
- Included default scopes (openid, profile, email) to maintain existing functionality
- This change allows the application to access the user's email information through Auth0

### Required Manual Steps
1. Log into Auth0 Dashboard
2. Go to application settings
3. Under "Permissions (API Scopes)", add the 'read:email' scope
4. Ensure the scope is enabled in API settings

### Testing
- Manual testing required to verify email permission is granted
- Verify that the access token includes the email scope
- Test that the application can successfully retrieve user email information
